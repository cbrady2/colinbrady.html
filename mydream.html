          <h2> My Dream </h2>
          <p> Saying that I found my calling/dream at the age of 17 is a blessing is an understatement. Most people struggle to find their
          calling, or never find it. It's a journey of being lost and found. I was lost in my life, only having an idea of what I wanted to
          do. But when you're found, you are grateful for having been lost. My dream is to travel to every country, and then open up organizations
          for the poorer countries in the world to help the people that have a daily struggle of getting food and water everyday. I hope to have
          a worldwide organization starting in the African countries, going to the middle eastern countries, then finding itself everywhere. There's
          no better reward in this life than having the impact on others. People might think this goal is absolutely insane. Travel every country in 
          the world? And question why I don't just get a great paying coorporate job in the U.S. The answer is simple, why do the same thing
          that millions are doing, live, work my whole life for another person, and have no benefit on this world, and die. Or do something
          that will effect the life of millions.
