          <h2> My Dream </h2>
          <p> Saying that I found my calling/dream at the age of 17 is a blessing is an understatement. Most people struggle to find their
          calling, or never find it. It's a journey of being lost and found. I was lost in my life, only having an idea of what I wanted to
          do. But when you're found, you are grateful for having been lost. My dream is to travel to every country, and then open up organizations
          for the poorer countries in the world to help the people that have a daily struggle of getting food and water everyday. I hope to have
          a worldwide organization starting in the African countries, going to the middle eastern countries, then finding itself everywhere. There's
          no better reward in this life than having the impact on others. People might think this goal is absolutely insane. Travel every country in 
          the world? And question why I don't just get a great paying coorporate job in the U.S. The answer is simple, why do the same thing
          that millions are doing, live, work my whole life for another person, and have no benefit on this world, and die. Or do something
          that will effect the life of millions.</p>

          <h2> Why travel?</h2>
          <p> My travel bug is at an all time high. Traveling makes me feel more alive than ever before. I find myself planning out
          future trips in class. My upcoming vacation includes going to Colombia the summer of 2020 for two months all alone. I'm doing
          it to find a focus in my gym, and basketball. And also to touch up on my spanish speaking ability. </p>

          <h2> Organizations </h2>
          <p> A question I've gotten asked was why not just make organizations in the U.S and help your own people. To answer that, the world is our
          own people, and i'd perfer to start where people have zero to nothing. Being a developed country, many people can receive aid, and while still struggling
          they do not have it the worst. As of now countries such as Yeman have little kids dying due to malnutrtion, and all living in war struck cities, which is 
          defiantly not a way to live a life as a little kid. </p>
