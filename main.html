      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p> Hi my name is Colin Brady, I am a 19 year old sophomore college student that attends Molloy College with the intention to receive a

        bachelors degree in New Media, and a minor in Graphic Design. I am also on the Men's Basketball Team. My background comes from Stroudsburg, PA. I have 3 brothers, 2 older, 1 younger. </p>

                    <br>

                    <h1> My Dream </h1>

                    <p> Growing up my family did not travel much, but when we did it was always an experience that I loved. My first time leaving the country was when I was 17 to Montreal, Canada for a basketball tournament. I loved the experience as I was in a french speaking area, and learned about their new customs. I was destined to travel more, so I made it my word after my first year of college to go somewhere, anywhere. So I booked a flight to Puerto Rico. By myself. For 2 weeks. With less than $1000. I was called brave, stupid, that i will die. Instead I had the most memorable time of my life. It grew my travel bug to an immense level. My dream is to travel every country on this Earth. Also to raise awareness to events going on in parts of the world that are unspoken about. I dream one day I will have organizations that will feed the hungry, and shelter the homeless.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>I want to document my journey, so I take classes in college that will help give me the skill to do so. Also I can easily work from my laptop, and make a living from that. I don't plan to make the journey super quick, I intend to live in other countries, learn and practice languages of others, so I can feel, and take in every second of it.
