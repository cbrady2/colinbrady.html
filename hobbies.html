             <h2> Basketball </h2>  INSERT BASKETBALL PIC
               <p> 
                  My number one hobbie without a doubt is basketball. I can be doing basketball related stuff for sometimes
                 30 hours a week. Whether it's watching NBA games, highlights, working out for basketball related stuff, or 
                 playing basketball in general. It takes a large chunk of my week since about 5th grade. Now my schedule includes about
                 weight room about 2-3 hours a week for basketball, treatment for about 2 hours a week, and actually basketball for about
                 2-3 hours a day, for 6 days a week. When the season is not going on in the summer sometimes I will find myself playing 
                 basketball for 4-6 hours a day. It is a hobby that has shaped my life, and my friends.

             <h2> Reading/Studying </h2> SOME BOOKS IN MY ROOM
              <p> 
                  "The seeking of knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim" -Al Tirmidhi, Hadith 74. Being a muslim, the seeking of 
                knowledge is obligatory, so a hobby I have is reading books on my free time. Another hobby I do every here and then is 
                studying languages, which I find very fun and challeneging. Basically taught myself Spanish, it was easier to pick up 
                because I grew up in a big spanish environment. I'm now currently working on my Arabic which I find a lot more difficult, due
                to having to learn a whole new alphabet, and having zero similarities to English. A plus for me is I find the prunciation 
                easy, while most people would struggle with that.

             <h2> Video Games </h2> MY FAV GAME
              <p> 
                This was truley my first passion before sports. I can remember since a young age playing Monkey Ball, Turok, Pikman, & Mario
                Kart Double Dash on the game cube. All the way until the days now where if I have any free time, I'll play the newest Call Of 
                Duty. I started gaming hard when I was in 4th-7th grade with Halo. I remember playing Halo 3 on summer days from the time I woke 
                up till my dad left for work at 7am. I decided one day unless I wanted to be a pro gamer that games don't do me any good. Also I
                was very unhappy with basketball as I was a 3rd string player in 8th grade. So I sold my xbox and decided that playing basketball
                is more important. The next season I was 2nd in the team in scoring, and a starter, so that investment paid off.

             <h2> New Hobbies </h2> CRAZY PHOTO IN DIF COUNTRYS
             <p> 
                I'm recently starting to fall in love with the idea of video story telling, and editing. It is all knew to me, and I don't even
               own a computer so I won't be for certain how much I'll really like it until I invest the time needed into it. But it did intrigue
               me enough for me to change my major to New Media with a minor of Graphic Design. I feel like it really does its best at bringing the
               creativity out of me. Also with the lifestyle I want to live, video story telling, and photography would appeal greatly to other, 
               and be a great source of income for me to make. With photography, and video story telling, I can reveal the truth about the 
               many misconceptions going on in the World now.
